                        <h3>Now let's see how the heart functions.</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Superior Vena Cava: Carries deoxygenated blood from the upper body to the heart.</li>
                            <li>Inferior Vena Cava: Carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body to the heart.</li>
                            <li>Right Atrium: Receives blood from both Vena Cavae.</li>
                            <li>Tricuspid Valve: Allows blood flow from the Right Atrium to the Right Ventricle.</li>
                            <li>Right Ventricle: Pumps blood to the lungs via the Pulmonary Artery.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary Artery: Transports deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary Vein: Returns oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart (Left Atrium).</li>
                            <li>Left Atrium: Receives oxygenated blood from the Pulmonary Vein.</li>
                            <li>Left Ventricle: Pumps oxygenated blood to the body via the Aorta.</li>
                            <li>Aorta: The body's largest artery; distributes oxygenated blood throughout the body.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>More about the Heart</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The time required for the heart to make one full heartbeat is just 0.8 seconds</li>
                        <li>The heart is a muscle: It's the strongest muscle in the body, constantly working.</li>
                        <li>Electrical impulses: The heart's rhythm is controlled by electrical impulses generated within the heart itself.</li>
                        <li>Four chambers: The heart has four chambers: two atria (receiving chambers) and two ventricles (pumping chambers).</li>
                        <li>Valves: One-way valves prevent blood from flowing backward.</li>
                        <li>Coronary arteries: These arteries supply the heart muscle with blood and oxygen.</li>
                        <li>Sinoatrial (SA) node: This is the heart's natural pacemaker, initiating the heartbeat.</li>
                        <li>Heart rate variability: A healthy heart's rate changes based on activity and stress levels.</li>
                        <li>Cardiac output: This is the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute</li>
                        <li>Blood pressure: The force of blood against artery walls, influenced by the heart's pumping action.</li>
                        <li>Autonomic nervous system: This system regulates heart rate and blood pressure, often unconsciously.</li>
                    </ul>
